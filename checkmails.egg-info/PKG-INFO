Description: 
        CheckMails periodically looks for unread mails and displays the total number
        of unread mails in the system tray icon. Several mailboxes can be configured.
        The number of unread mails for each mailbox is detailed in a notification
        that appears when clicking on the icon and after a check. This application
        supports only IMAP protocol with SSL encryption. The connection information
        for each mailbox is stored in an encrypted file using a master password.
